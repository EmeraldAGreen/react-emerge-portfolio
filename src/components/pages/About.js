          Hi, my name is Emerald Green, and I am a full-stack Web Application Developer, currently living in Denver, CO. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Organismal Biology & Ecology and Classics from Colorado College. I committed my post-undergraduate career to advancing equity with mission-based organizations in my community. I serve as the Consumer Assistance Program Coordinator for Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and the Program Coordinator for the F2F project at Family Voices Colorado. I am excited to apply my skills in problem-solving and project management to web development, and I am currently  honing my technical skills with the University of Denverâ€™s coding bootcamp.
